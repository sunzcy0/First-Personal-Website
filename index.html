    <h1>Hello! I'm Gaby</h1>
    <h2>Aspiring Full Stack Developer & Computer Science Student</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm passionate about turning ideas into real, functional software using different programming languages, and beyond. As a curious and dedicated Computer Science student, I’m constantly learning and building. This space is where I share my journey, projects, and everything I’m creating along the way.</p>

        <p>
        Lately, I've been diving into the world of web development, exploring tools like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm currently working on personal projects where I get to mix logic, creativity, and a bit of fun.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm really into digital organization and enjoy learning new things on my own, especially when it comes to tech that makes everyday life a little easier (and prettier).
        </p>
        <p>
        When I'm not at my computer, you'll probably find me reading, knitting, writing, listening to music, or practicing Japanese.
        </p>
        <p>
        This little corner of the internet is my cozy space to share what I'm building, discovering, and dreaming up. Thanks so much for stopping by! 🌸
