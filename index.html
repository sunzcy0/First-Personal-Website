    <h2>About Myself</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Gaby 🧸, a curious and passionate Computer Science student who loves to bring ideas to life through code.</p>

    <p>
    Lately, I've been diving into the world of web development, exploring tools like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm currently working on personal projects where I get to mix logic, creativity, and a bit of fun.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm really into digital organization and enjoy learning new things on my own, especially when it comes to tech that makes everyday life a little easier (and prettier).
    </p>

    <p>
    When I'm not at my computer, you'll probably find me reading, knitting, writing, listening to music, or practicing Japanese.
    </p>

    <p>
    This little corner of the internet is my cozy space to share what I'm building, discovering, and dreaming up. Thanks so much for stopping by! 🌸
